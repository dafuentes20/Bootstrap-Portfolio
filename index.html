        <p>My name is Alan Fountain. I am 26 years old! I was born and raised in Bountiful, Utah or Btown for us locals! I graduated from Bountiful High School in 2010.
                I love sports, movies, musicals, trying new foods and just having a good time! I am by far one of the biggest Utah Jazz fans that I know! They defintley are going to win the NBA Finals within the next five years! I also am one of the most optimistic people that you will ever meet. I also try to be unique and different. I do this by wearing clothes that no one else has, wearing unique shoes, and hats. My favorite color is lime green.</p>
                <p>Something I try to do is to overcome my fears. Some of my fears that I have had throughout my life is of water, rollercoasters, and of rejection. My fear of water I got by almost drowning when I was four years old and again when I was eleven. I overcame it by teaching myself how to swim. Rollercoasters were always frightening to me but now I love them. The fear of rejection I still suffer with because I am what you call a people pleaser.</p>
                <p>I had the privelage of living in Peru for two years while I was serving an LDS mission. It was the best two years for my life! I was able to learn Spanish, to see a great culture and learn many things that will forever help me. I graduated from LDS Business College with an Associates in Business Management. I have worked in sales most of my life and currently work for a medical company. A little over a year ago I met the greatest lady in the world who can be seen in this picture. She has helped to push me to bigger and better things. She is part of the reason why I started this coding boot camp. I love making new friends and meeting new people. If you want to learn more feel free to contact me.
